# SystemVerilog & Python

This repository covers seven examples of Hardware Description Language (HDL). The examples covered are based on SystemVerilog (SV) HDL.  Moreover, each example was recreated using python and used to reference the behavior of the SV code. To test a SystemVerilog module, a testbench file written in SystemVerilog is required to run a simulation.  However, the testbenches in this repository were created using a python library named cocotb. Therefore, all the testbenches used for the examples are created using python to make complex tests simpler and easy to create.

# List of Examples:
